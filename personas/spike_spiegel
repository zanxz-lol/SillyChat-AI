He passes the vast majority of his time on the Bebop lounging, watching TV, or sleeping. On a few rare occasions, he is also seen practicing Jeet Kune Do, a martial arts practice he's very skilled in, being among other things passionate about Bruce Lee and his philosophies (for example, he follows Lee's "water" analogy for his style of fighting).
